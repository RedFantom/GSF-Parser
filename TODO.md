# TODO List

## Features planned
- Implement the name functions of the GSF Server
  * The GSF-Server has working capabilities to save name-ID combinations
  * Allow the GSF Parser to create a local database of these name-ID combinations
  
- Real-time events overlay
  * With support for coloured events
  * Only the last event with the source and target name with ability name is displayed
  * Multiple positioning options
  * Size and font options (font options shared with real-time overlay)

## Dropped features
These previously planned features have been dropped until further notice:

- The leaderboard functionality
  
  All other sharing/GSF-Server-communication functionality is still planned
  
- Support for CombatLogs generated in another language

  The priority for this feature is very low
  
- Galactic StarFighter themed interface
  
  Because of the new `Arc` theme that looks better than the previous `plastik` theme, the time required 
  to create such a theme is not worth it 
  
## Ideas

- More support for calculating contributions by allied team players
- Support for number of enemies damage taken from, not just damage dealt to
- Real-time kill count overlay
- Reading the position of the player on the map
