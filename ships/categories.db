S'Designed primarily for destroying satellites, bunkers and similar armored or immobile objectives, the Elsinore-Cordova Sledgehammer is more maneuverable than other bombers but possesses a somewhat weaker hull. The Sledgehammer can carry either missiles or torpedoes and can be equipped with mines and drones as auxiliary systems; in addition, it can utilize heavy laser cannons. While not an ideal ship for dogfighting, very few structures can survive a fully armed Sledgehammer bearing down.'

The Condor is also faster and more maneuverable than its counterparts and can equip a variety of shields and engines.

A Flashfire may not compete head-on against a strike fighter, but its maneuverability may be the edge a skilled pilot needs."

The Star Guard carries two primary blasters and gains maneuverability over other strike fighter-class ships at the cost of defensive strength. The Star Guard can support an array of laser and ion cannons that allow it to engage foes at multiple distances, but its lack of heavy ordnance makes it less effective against armored objectives. When it comes to dogfighting, however, there may be no finer ship in the galaxy."

S"Darth Mekhis herself developed the prototype for the ICA-X Tormentor and instructed Chiss engineers on how to bring her fearsome vision to life. This infiltrator-class vessel eschews high-damage secondary weapons in favor of weapons that disable, and it can be equipped with a wide array of technologies designed to baffle foes' sensors. Perhaps most notable is the Tormentor's cloaking field, which can extend to encompass allies--allowing the use of terrifying, otherwise impossible team tactics."

S"Imperial starfighter squadrons drill relentlessly so that their pilots fly and fight with a single mind. For ultimate coordination, the Tandankin shipyards S-SC4 Bloodmark is practically a necessity. Sacrificing some speed and maneuverability along with ship-to-ship missiles in exchange for some of the galaxy's best sensors and communications technology, the Bloodmark also possesses unique subsystems for improved battlefield awareness. A squadron containing an expert Bloodmark pilot can act with greater efficiency than any other."

S"The Imperial Tandankin shipyards produce a small number of elite scout craft used for both reconnaissance and lightning strikes. The S-12 Blackbolt combines extraordinary speed, maneuverability and strafing capacity with powerful sensors and communications rigs. Enemies can be spotted early and their locations relayed to allies--or a Blackbolt pilot can take foes on directly with short- and mid-range laser cannons. Stationary objectives are prime targets for the Blackbolt's rockets. The Blackbolt has only bare-bones defenses, however, with weak shields and a thin, unarmored hull. For that reason, Blackbolt pilots often earn reputations as thrill-seekers or suicidal fools (or sometimes both)."

S"The shipyards of Tandankin have served the Imperial war machine for decades, specializing in experimental designs. With its array of laser cannons, ship-to-ship missiles, and hardened armor and shields, the Tandankin-built S-13 Sting barely qualifies as a scout, but it maintains considerable sensor and communications range diminished only in comparison to other scout-class vessels. Its weapons and defenses still don't match those of a full strike fighter, but it can be just as deadly in the right hands."

S"The Czerka IL-5 Ocula was the company's first entry into the modern scout starfighter field, and utilizes a number of proprietary miniaturization techniques to ensure that nearly all popular internal components can be accommodated. Imperial military officials have shown a particular fondness for the design, ordering thousands of the craft through intermediaries while Czerka executives turn a blind eye. Imperial pilots often employ the craft on long-range reconnaissance missions into territories where their standard scout ships would be quickly recognized."

S"Although its design is derived from the FT-2 Quell, the Dromund Kalakar-built FT-3C Imperium lacks some of its counterpart's speed and maneuverability. Instead, the Imperium carries heavy defenses, state-of-the-art sensors and command-and-control systems--it is the pivot around which a squadron turns, bolstering and coordinating allies while under fire. Its secondary weapons are oriented toward eliminating armored objectives instead of dogfighting; Imperium pilots are conquerors first and warriors second."

S'The ultimate Imperial dogfighter, the F-T6 Rycer (named for an ace Imperial pilot of the last war) is a product of the Dromund Kalakar shipyards. The Rycer can be fitted with two primary blasters from an arsenal of options, including multiple laser and ion cannons; properly equipped, it can destroy or disable foes at any range. The Rycer is even more maneuverable than most strike fighters, but its defenses are less formidable-a fair trade, according to its pilots.'

S'Tradition is as important as innovation at the Dromund Kalakar shipyards, and each new design must also honor the past. The F-T2 Quell brings an old name to a fresh exemplar of strike fighter design, possessing speed, maneuverability and good defenses coupled with twin secondary weapon systems that can be switched over mid-combat. This flexibility enables a Quell to carry (for example) both ship-to-ship missiles and torpedoes, allowing it to take on both enemy vessels and stationary objectives.'

S'As a venerable starfighter design sold to security forces on many of the worlds conquered by the Empire, uncountable thousands of TZ-24 Gladiators have fallen into Imperial hands over the years. Adapted from the larger TZ-2 transport, the Enforcer was designed to serve as a rugged, no-frills combat fighter for long campaigns in remote regions. The Empire has done little to alter the model given its excellent performance record, and regularly fields the Enforcer alongside its standard starfighter complements.'
