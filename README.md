# GSF-Parser-Public
A parser for Star - Wars The Old Republic: Galactic StarFighter, written by RedFantom

This is the public repository for stable releases of the Galactic StarFighter parser. The parser asks the user to enter a directory for the CombatLogs generated by SWTOR first, and then the user can enter a filename for a file to parse. More features will be coming soon.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own Star Wars, Star Wars - The Old Republic or Galactic StarFighter or any related trademarks.

This program is intended for educational uses only, as the user can learn how to  play GSF better by using it. Therefore, I claim fair-use for all mentioned trade-marks.
